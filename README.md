# Pulsar-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A pulsar is an exceptionally polarized pivoting neutron star or white smaller person that emits a light emission radiation.
This radiation can be watched just when the light emission is highlighting Earth and is answerable for the beat appearance of emanation. 
To predict these pulsar stars we are implementing the model using some machine learning algorithms like decision tree, random forest, etc. 
Pulsars are one of the possibilities for the wellspring of ultra-high-vitality enormous beams. 
We have tried various models, including decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, and support vector machine to predict pulsar stars, to get high accuracy, precision, and recall from all those models.
